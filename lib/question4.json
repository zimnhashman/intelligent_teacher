  "comprehension":"Precious and Zendaya were talking in the street. They saw Vimbai "
  "with a girl they didn’t know. “Hi,” said Vimbai. “This is Bethsaida. "
  "She lives near my home.”“Hello,” said Precious. “We were talking "
  "about what we want to do in five years’ time. We were thinking "
  "about what jobs we could do.” “And I’ve got two children to look after, "
  "and chores to do,” said Bethsaida. “That’s like a full-time "
  "job on its own.” “I know, but try and imagine,” said Precious. "
  "“I think I’m good at organising things,” said Vimbai. “Maybe I "
  "could start my own business.” “I’d like to work in a bank,” "
  "said Bethsaida. “I’m interested in numbers and counting.”"
  "“I hope you get that job,” said Vimbai. “Then we can come "
  "to your bank, and you can give us lots of money!” “That would be nice,” "
  "said Bethsaida, “But it doesn’t work like that!”“What about you, Precious?” "
  "asked Zendaya. “I want to work on my family’s land and make it better.” said "
  "Precious. “I’ll help you!” said Zendaya, with a big smile."
